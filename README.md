Public Help Desk Portal is a web application where we can create a complaint or view previous complaints if any. User can 
register or login, create complaint and get OTP verification. This is a greate alternative as it solely does the job of taking 
complaints and solving them. Admin has the privilege to edit complaints or check the status.
